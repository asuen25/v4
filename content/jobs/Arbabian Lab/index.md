- Designed 2nd generation PCB boards for sonar detection in ocean mapping using photoacoustic effect
- Engineered a 6-layer sensor logic board in Altium to support up to 128 imaging sensors
- Developed a custom C++ SPI sniffer that cut packet decoding time from 5s to 1ms (99% reduction)
- Built a real-time ARM Cortex-M7 pipeline achieving 15 MHz decoding with a 4 ms packet interval
- Reduced board size by over 50% on next-gen sensor boards via circuit design changes
- Improved signal stability by ~70% through optimized data capture and MATLAB processing
